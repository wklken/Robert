## Task
Repair the reported CI failure within the pinned PR snapshot.

## Work
CI remediation workflow:
- Treat the supplied failure summary as evidence, not as a complete diagnosis.
- Start by inspecting the exact PR snapshot and reproduce the reported failure locally when possible.
- Make only the change needed to repair the reported failure, then run focused and required verification and create a new commit.
- Do not rebase or force-push. Robert will revalidate the remote PR snapshot before publication.
